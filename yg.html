						<h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
						<div class="box">
							<p>The manufacturing industry is a domain unfamiliar to me. The production processes within this field are highly complex and frequently subject to changes. The challenge of our system lies in maintaining stability amidst constant variations. I've dedicated considerable effort to researching and studying critical aspects such as authorization control, process management, and addressing evolving business requirements. I've formulated a comprehensive and tailored solution to address various challenges in production and sales. Moreover, I've strived to make each process segment configurable in the backend, ensuring ease of future process adaptations.
