									<h3>Project Overview</h3>
									<p>
										The "Baidu Public Transit Tycoon" app, developed by Baidu, offers a unique way to earn money while using public transportation. Users complete simple tasks during their daily bus rides, such as taking photos and checking in, to receive rewards and save on commuting costs. Additionally, the app provides real-time bus route information and rewards users for submitting accurate data about bus stops and stations across China.

												<h3>Role and Responsibilities</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>Developed the task list module to display current city's public transit tasks, allowing users to filter tasks based on criteria such as distance and points.</li>
													<li>Constructed the task collection interface, enabling users to capture photos and data at initial, final, and midpoint stations, with features like station management.</li>
													<li>Implemented the task upload functionality, enabling users to submit completed tasks for backend review</li>
													<li>Designed the backend review system to ensure the legitimacy of submitted task data, rewarding points upon successful verification</li>
												</ul>

												<h3>Technologies and Tools Used</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
													<li>Back-end: PHP, Yaf framework, PostgreSQL, Kafaka</li>
													<li>Version Control: Git</li>
													<li>DevOps: Baidu cloud, CI, CD pipeline</li>
												</ul>

												<h3>Project Challenges and Solutions</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
													<li>Challenge: Task Filtering and Management.</li>
													<li>Solution: Addressing the need for efficient task management, we developed a task list module that allowed users to filter tasks based on distance and points. This streamlined users' ability to find tasks that matched their preferences.
													</li>
													<li>Challenge: Data Integrity and Security.</li>
													<li>Solution: Compress, package, and slice large-sized images to improve upload success rate and user experience. In addition, we employed encryption techniques helped safeguard sensitive information.</li>
													<li>Challenge: Real-Time Map Integration.
													</li>
													<li>
														Solution: We integrated real-time map services. This provided users with a dynamic visual representation of their progress within the app.
													</li>
												</ul>

												<h3>Project Goals and Achievements</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
													<li>The rewarding of points and their conversion into cash has significantly boosted user engagement, ensuring sustained user activity over the long term. This approach has also enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of maintaining our public transit routes and stations, ultimately providing users with more precise and convenient data.</li>
													<li>Recommend local tasks based on the user's proximity, making it easier for users to participate in tasks.						</li>
												</ul>

												<h3>Team Collaboration and Communication</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
													<li>Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, discussing requirements with product managers, coordinating interface design with designers, and troubleshooting issues with testing engineers.</li>
													<li>Through ongoing communication and collaboration, we were able to address challenges promptly and ensure the project's progress as planned.</li>
												</ul>
