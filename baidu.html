												<!-- <h3>Role and Responsibilities</h3> -->
												<h3>Introduction</h3>
												During my tenure as a Senior PHP Developer at Baidu's Map department, I had the opportunity to maintain and develop the Public Transportation Platform, playing a crucial role in its continuous improvement and evolution. Baidu, a global AI and Internet company, tasked me with improving the management of the nation's public transport systems, including buses and subways. By introducing a new algorithm, I successfully boosted task assignment accuracy for map data collectors by an impressive 50%. Furthermore, I streamlined the data upload process in Baidu Map Transit Tycoon app, leading to a remarkable 40% increase in the success rate for handling large collection packages. These enhancements played a pivotal role in reducing user complaints by 30%.												<!-- <ul>
													<li>Developed the task list module to display current city's public transit tasks, allowing users to filter tasks based on criteria such as distance and points.</li>
													<li>Constructed the task collection interface, enabling users to capture photos and data at initial, final, and midpoint stations, with features like station management.</li>
													<li>Implemented the task upload functionality, enabling users to submit completed tasks for backend review.</li>
													<li>Designed the backend review system to ensure the legitimacy of submitted task data, rewarding points upon successful verification.</li>
												</ul>

												<h3>Technologies and Tools Used</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
													<li>Back-end: PHP, Yaf framework, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Kafaka</li>
													<li>Version Control: Git</li>
													<li>DevOps: Baidu cloud, CI, CD pipeline</li>
												</ul>

												<h3>Project Challenges and Solutions</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
													<li>Challenge: Nearest Task Recommendation.</li>
													<li>Solution: I designed an algorithm that calculates distances based on latitude and longitude, and then sorts based on the calculated distances.														.
													</li>
													<li>Challenge: Data Integrity and Security.</li>
													<li>Solution: Compress, package, and slice large-sized images to improve upload success rate and user experience. In addition, we employed encryption techniques helped safeguard sensitive information.</li>
													<li>Challenge: Real-Time Map Integration.
													</li>
													<li>
														Solution: We integrated real-time map services. This provided users with a dynamic visual representation of their progress within the app.
													</li>
												</ul> -->

												<!-- <h3>Project Goals and Achievements</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
													<li>The rewarding of points and their conversion into cash has significantly boosted user engagement, ensuring sustained user activity over the long term. This approach has also enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of maintaining our public transit routes and stations, ultimately providing users with more precise and convenient data.</li>
													<li>Recommend local tasks based on the user's proximity, making it easier for users to participate in tasks.						</li>
												</ul> -->

												<!-- <h3>Team Collaboration and Communication</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
													<li>Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, discussing requirements with product managers, coordinating interface design with designers, and troubleshooting issues with testing engineers.</li>
													<li>Through ongoing communication and collaboration, we were able to address challenges promptly and ensure the project's progress as planned.</li>

									<p>
										In my role as a backend developer specializing in map application development, I've gained expertise in managing diverse databases to efficiently store and retrieve large-scale geographical data. This experience has deepened my understanding of database design and administration, ensuring optimal data organization and retrieval. Additionally, I've honed my skills in utilizing GIS tools and libraries, allowing me to manipulate geographic data effectively by performing tasks such as extraction, conversion, and projection. Furthermore, my proficiency in integrating third-party APIs has enabled me to enhance map applications with external services seamlessly. Overall, my journey has equipped me with a well-rounded skill set to design and manage databases, leverage GIS tools, and seamlessly integrate APIs in the dynamic field of map application development.
