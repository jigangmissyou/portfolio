				<H3>Introduction</H3>
				<p>
					As the Principal Developer in our team, I spearheaded the development of a shuttle booking application for Weltec and Whitireia, catering to students at Petone and Porirua campuses. Working in close collaboration with our client, the Learning Support Team, we conducted regular meetings to grasp their specific requirements. Leveraging an Agile approach, we analyzed, developed, tested, and successfully deployed the application to the production. 
This achievement led to a 2-hour reduction in the daily workload for the Learning Support Teams at each campus, granting them extra time to focus on supporting the students.
