					<h3>Role and Responsibilities</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Designed and implemented core platform features, including user authentication, recharge, withdrawal, loan applications, and investment opportunity showcasing.</li>
						<li>Engaged in both front-end and back-end development, contributing to user-friendly interfaces and robust data processing.</li>
						<li>Addressed challenges related to data security and privacy, ensuring the appropriate protection of user information.</li>
						<li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including product managers, designers, and testing engineers, to ensure timely project delivery.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Technologies and Tools Used</h3>
					Throughout the project, I utilized various technologies and tools, including but not limited to:
					<ul class="alt">
						<li>Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jquery</li>
						<li>Back-end: PHP, ThinkPHP framework,Phalcon framework, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMq</li>
						<li>Version Control: Git</li>
						<li>Security: Encryption techniques, authentication and authorization methods</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Project Challenges and Solutions</h3>
					<ul class="alt">
						<li>Challenge: We encountered challenges related to data privacy and security, particularly when handling personal and financial information of users.</li>
						<li>Solution: To address this, we implemented robust encryption techniques and authorization processes to safeguard user data.The communication between browsers and servers is encrypted using SSL/TLS.Core business interfaces such as registration, deposit, investment, and withdrawal utilize encryption algorithms like SHA, AES, RSA, etc., for secure data transmission.
						</li>
						<li>Challenge: A large number of users simultaneously accessing and trading can lead to server performance bottlenecks and response delays.</li>
						<li>Solution: Implement a distributed architecture, utilize load balancing techniques, cache popular data(using memached, redis), and implement horizontal scaling to handle high concurrency. </li>
						<li>Challenge: Ensuring the consistency of transaction and account data across multiple data sources and systems is a challenge.
						</li>
						<li>
							Solution: Implement a distributed transaction mechanism, use a message queue to ensure the consistency of data between multiple systems, and regular data synchronization between multiple data sources.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Project Goals and Achievements</h3>
					<ul class="alt">
						<li>The primary objective of the project was to establish a secure and efficient financial platform, facilitating lending and investment activities between individuals and businesses.</li>
						<li>My work contributed to the realization of essential platform functionalities, enabling users to easily browse investment opportunities, submit loan applications, and conduct transactions.</li>
						<li>Following the successful launch of the platform, there was a substantial increase in user registrations and activity, demonstrating the positive business outcomes resulting from our team's efforts.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Team Collaboration and Communication</h3>
					<ul class="alt">
						<li>Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, discussing requirements with product managers, coordinating interface design with designers, and troubleshooting issues with testing engineers.</li>
						<li>Through ongoing communication and collaboration, we were able to address challenges promptly and ensure the project's progress as planned.</li>
					</ul>
